                    <p>Progress made in research on female serial killers has allowed psychologists to create different typologies. A typology is a set of subtypes that are used in this case to describe a type of killer. Several different typologies have been developed, and they each have varying subtypes, some of the most used typologies are the Holmes typology, the Rappaport typology, and the Dietz typology. Here we will go through the different typologies that researchers have created and compiled and discuss the subtypes that pertain to female serial killers. Below you will find the links to the pages where the motivations, characteristics, methods, and descriptions will be listed and discussed. </p>

                    <h3>Black Widow</h3>
                         <p>The Black Widow is a subtype/nickname for female serial killers who are known for killing family members or spouses (Miller, 2014). This subtype is found in several different typologies such as the Holmes and Holmes typology of serial killers, and Kelleher and Kelleher’s typology of female serial murderers are the main ones (Miller, 2014; Farrell et al., 2013). <a href="blackwidow.html">Click here to learn more.</a></p>

                    <h3>Angel of Death</h3>
                     <p>Angel of Death Killer is another common subtype and stereotype of female serial killers. This subtype of killer falls into the Deitz typology, Rappaport typology, Holmes and Holmes typology, and Kelleher and Kelleher’s typology. Angel of death can pertain to both men and women but is a common subtype of female serial killers (Miller, 2014; Farrell et al., 2013). This type of killer is known for killing people who are in their care. <a href="aod.html">Click here to learn more.</a>

                    <h3>Team/Partner Killer</h3>
                        <p>Some female serial killers chose to work in a team or with another person (Miller, 2014; Farrell et al., 2013; Gurian, 2017). This subtype of killer does not fall into any of the other typologies discussed. The partner/team model has its subtypes (Miller, 2014). Miller details the types/categories that Philip Jenkins, a fellow researcher has created. These categories include Dominant–submissive pairs, Equally dominant teams, Extended family or group, and Organized or ceremonial social groups. <a href="partner.html">Click here to learn more.</a>

                    <h3>Other Types of Killers</h3>
                    <p>While those subtypes stated above tend to be the most commonly researched and occurring subtypes of female serial killers there are a couple of other types. According to Kelleher and Kelleher’s typology of female serial murderers as described by Farrell et al. (2015).
                          
                    </p> 
                    <ul>
                            <li>Sexual predators - extremely rare and may share some characteristics with their male counterparts but research is currently inconclusive.</li>
                            <li>For-profit or crime - This subtype will kill for financial or material gain. These are different from black widow killers since they target victims outside of the family unit. They are normally very organized in their crimes and start their sprees later in life. Sprees will typically last 5 - 10 years. </li>
                            <li>Question of Sanity - typically a woman who kills because of a mental illness (has some overlap with the angel of death when Munchausen by Proxy is present).</li>
                            <li>The unexplained - this is for women who consistently kill, but law enforcement or researchers are unable to find a consistent motive. However, women who have killed children tend to be placed into this category </li>
                        </ul>
