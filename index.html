                    <p>The study of serial killers is relatively new. It is believed to have started/gathered traction mainly in the 1970s. The era of criminal profiling and the study of serial killers was kicked off by John Douglas and his partner (Douglas & Olshaker, 1996). Douglasâ€™ book, Mindhunter, details his time in the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), specifically in the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) formerly known as Behavioral Sciences Unit. The book discusses how he and his partner(s) started to collect data and information on serial killers. They went around to several different convicted and imprisoned serial killers to interview them. During these interviews, they would ask questions regarding why, how, what, and their thoughts regarding their murders. This data set collected by the BAU is now the basis for a lot of studies done on serial killers. This process also started an interest in studying people of this nature that continues into today.  </p>

                    <p>While Douglas and his partners at the FBI kick-started research that has fascinated the masses. The research is now continued by psychologists who now analyze the data to try and understand why these killers are the way they are. These psychologists/psychiatrists attempt to create psychological profiles using the data collected as well as brain scans and other biological data to detail brain chemistry that could explain why people are capable of committing these gruesome crimes (Allely et al., 2014). </p>

                    <p>However, an even more recent subsection of this research is the study of female serial killers. This website is dedicated to understanding the female serial killer and will detail the make and psychological profile of them while going over the sex differences, typologies, motivations, methods, and everything in-between. To obtain an even better understanding of the female serial killer and the application of criminal profiling, there will also be a case study on Aileen Wuornos.</p>
