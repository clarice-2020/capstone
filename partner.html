                            <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The partner or team killer is another common subtype of the female serial killer (FSK). These teams/sets of partners can be made up of both females, although it is very rare, or female and a male(s) (Farrell et at., 2013; Miller, 2014; Gurian, 2011). The teams/partners can use a bait and catch type of model when committing their crimes, this is most common in the Dominant–submissive pair. In this pair typically one person, the dominant one will commit the murder and the other will lure the victim in. Pairs can also commit the murder together or bait the victims together. Women in these pairs or teams tend to be less mature and more reactive than their solo counterparts (Farrell et al., 2013). Below there are more specific characteristics relating to the partnered/team killer subtype.

                             <h3>Motives</h3>
                                 <p> The motives for team/partnered killers vary depending on the type of team killer. In some of the teams/pairs, the women may be motivated to kill or bait victims because they want to please the male or other female in the pair (Farrell et al., 2013) Other motives could be sexual.

                            <h3>Victims</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The victims of the team/partnered FSK are most often adults the killers do not know (Gurian, 2017). They are also more likely to be female if there is a dominant male in the pair and more likely to be male or female if the partners have even power or are both females.

                            <h3>Method</h3>
                                <p>
                                    There is not a specific common method used for murder when the killers are in pairs (Farrell et al., 2013; Gurian, 2011; Gurian, 2017; Miller, 2014). It is common, however, for the pair or team to torture the victim, often raping them, before killing them. The pair will often tie up their victims before torturing and murdering them.

                            <p>
                                The spree time for pairs or teams tends to be on the shorter side (Gurian, 2017). Some researchers speculate their time frames are more similar to the FSK male counterparts because in some teams/pairs the males take the lead (Farrell et al., 2013). The typical spree will last about 2 years (Farrell et al., Gurian, 2017).

                                Harrison et al., stated that Kelleher and Kelleher when doing their analysis on FSK in teams they found/believe that as many as ⅓ of all FSK kill in teams or pairs (2015).
