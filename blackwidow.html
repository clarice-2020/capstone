                            <h3>Description</h3>
                                <p>
                                  “Black widow” killers are a subtype of serial killer/female serial killer (FSK). The Holmes and Holmes typology categorizes female comfort-oriented killers as for Black Widow (Miller, 2014). They detail this type as someone who kills for “comfort”, some kind of material or financial gain. The Kelleher and Kelleher typology describes it more based on who the FSK kills, so husbands/spouses mainly and sometimes children or other relatives (Farrell et al., 2011; Farrell et al., 2013; Miller, 2014). Black Widows are also known to start their sprees later in life than their male counterparts. Since Black Widows are among the more common FSK types it has become a popular stereotype that has been portrayed in films, books, and more. Below there are more specific characteristics relating to the Black Widow subtype.

                                    comfort/profit-oriented: black widows often kill for money or other material goods. They often collect insurance policies, pensions, or other inheritance from their victims (Farrell et al., 2011; Gurian, 2011; Harrison et al. 2015; Miller, 2014).

                                The most common method black widows use is poison (Farrell et al., 2013)

                            They on average last at least 10 years (Farrell et al., 2013). Black widows tend to spread their murders out over longer periods since they kill people within their family unit.

                                In an analysis conducted by Farrell et al., it was determined that roughly 14% of FSK fall into the type of “Black Widow” (Farrell et al., 2013)
