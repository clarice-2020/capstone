                <div class="back">
                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>Aileen Wuornos Had a very difficult and complicated childhood. She was born on February 29th, 1956, in Rochester Michigan (Arrigo & Griffin, 2004). Wuornos’ parents were divorced before she was even born. Her mother attempted to be a single mother to Aileen and her older brother Kieth. However, her mother Diane abandoned her children when Aileen was about 6 months old and moved to Texas. After her mother abandoned both her and her brother her maternal grandparents took them in. It was around this time that Aileen’s father was convicted for molesting a 7-year-old girl. He was sent to prison and later killed himself before he was released. Aileen’s grandparents also struggled with mental health issues. Her grandmother has a drinking problem that ended up killing her when Aileen was 15 years old. Her grandfather also had a history of mental illness and distress since he was overbearing and controlling towards Ailleen’s mother and beat and abused Aileen and her brother. To add to this trauma her grandparents revealed to both Aileen and her brother that they were not their parents and that their mother, who they thought was their sister, had abandoned them. This led to Aileen and Kieth being alienated from the rest of the family. In addition to an already disruptive and hard childhood, their grandparents/parents did not show any affection towards them as children. </p>
                    <p>As Aileen got older the trauma and negligence from her childhood started to show up in her temper and actions. It was during her early teenage years when she started “selling”/exchanging her body for cigarettes or money to boys her age. It can also be assumed that Aileen experience some sexual trauma at this time. It was around this time, at the age of 15 that she became pregnant. The boy was put up for adoption after she gave birth. It is also likely that she endured trauma physically and mentally from being pregnant at such a young age in an unloving household. In her later teenage years, she turned to theft and had several encounters with the law. Soon after she dropped out of school and was kicked out of her grandparents' house. Within 5 years, both her grandmother and brother died, and she moved down to Florida, where she would commit her crimes.

                    <h3>The Murders</h3>
                    <p>Aileen would go on to kill 7 men throughout her spree. Aileen was active from late 1989 to early 1990 (Biography.com Editors, 2020). Aileen claimed to attract her victims by attempting to hitchhike and sell herself for sex on the Florida highways. Aileen would tell her victims that she was a prostitute (Arrigo & Griffin, 2004). If the men agreed to pay her she would then remove her clothes and tell them to do the same. It was then that she would get out of the car and grab her belongings. Once the men started to sense danger she would then shoot them. She was responsible for the death of 7 men.

                    <h3>Typology/Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Aileen Wuornos has often been seen as the only “real” female serial killer since her crimes match the level of violence used by most male serial killers. Aileen’s crimes, unlike most female serial killers, happened over several months, making her timeline more similar to those of the male serial killers. She also targeted middle-aged - older males that may have reminded her of her grandfather (Blanco, n.d.). They all also agreed to pay her for sex which could be another defining factor in why she chose them. Because her crimes involved the potential transaction of sex and asserting her dominance/trying to take control of the situation most researchers agree that she either falls into the hedonistic, Holmes typology, or the ‘power seeking type (also known as the power/control serial killer in the Holmes typology) (Frei et al., 2006). A hedonistic killer is a killer that can gain sexual pleasure from killing or prolonged torture and killing (Miller, 2014). I side with the researcher that believes she is a power/control serial killer since most of her life has been chaotic, lacked stability and she experienced several years of abuse from her grandfather and some would argue self-inflicted abuse.

                    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>Aileen had experienced trauma throughout most of her life starting as a baby she was abandoned and placed into an unstable abusive household. It is very likely that Aileen suffered from some form of PTSD or experienced the lasting effects of the trauma. It is also likely she suffered from depression. In addition to those mental illnesses, researchers have even looked into her attachment type (Frei et al., 2006). They determined the attachment style to be avoidant/dismissing. This means that she was often detached, hostile, had poor impulse control, and was socially withdrawn. These describe many of the characteristics that researchers detailed in Aileen’s behaviors. Likely, her attachment style, lack of support system, and possible mental illnesses were large factors in her becoming the famous serial killer she is today.
