                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Female serial killers (FSK) are a phenomenon that has been occurring for the last several centuries, however, researchers have just recently started to look at them more in-depth. Researchers have established that FSK commits their crimes differently from their male counterparts (Harrison et al., 2019). To detail, these differences and sometimes similarities researchers have created different typologies (Farrell, 2013; Miller, 2014). Some of these typologies include the Holmes and Holmes typology, the Rapport typology, and the Kelleher and Kelleher typology. The last typology specifically pertains only to female serial killers. This is useful since law enforcement and most previous research when they hear the term “serial murder/killer” tend to think of a sexually motivated male (Gurian, 2011). Having a typology specifically meant for female killers helps current researchers and law enforcement look for an analysis of new killers and data. Below we will discuss a brief overview of the FSK and will go over the sex differences, the characteristics, and the mental health issues associated with FSK.

                    <h3>Sex Differences</h3>
                    <p>As stated above FSK and their male counterparts rarely overlap in their characteristics associated with their crimes. An important part of understanding the FSK is understanding the differences between them and their male counterparts. One very blatant difference between the two is what Harrison et al. refer to as the “Hunter-Gatherer Model” (2019). This model specifically describes how each sex goes about choosing its victims. This model argues that the male serial killer (MSK) is more like a hunter because they tend to stalk, watch and hunt for their victims. While FSK on the other hand are seen as gatherers since they tend to kill the people around them whether it be family or friends they acquire for killing. One other big difference between the two is that FSK tends to go longer without detection (Farrell et al., 2013; Miller 2014). Some researchers believe this is because FSK tends to kill the same amount of people over a longer period, drawing less attention to the crimes. Another noticeable difference between the two sexes is the noticeable lack of violence (Farrell et al., 2011; Farrell et al., 2013; Gurian, 2011; Harrison et al., 2015; Miller, 2014). Researchers have found that women tend to use methods, like poison or suffocation, that are less physically violent compared to MSK. That being said, there is always an exception to the rule. Aileen Wuornos is the perfect example of a violent FSK. Some even consider Wuornos to be the first predatory FSK (Arrigo & Griffin, 2004). Wuornos is responsible for the death of 7 men who she shot and killed throughout her killing spree. Researchers believe the main motive/factor in Wuornos’ homicidal tendencies may be rooted in deep psychological trauma stemming from abuse from her grandfather when she was a child. This does however loop Wuornos back into the typical FSK typology since a lot of researchers and law enforcement believe that some FSK kills for revenge or in a reactive manner.

                    <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>Now that the main sex differences between MSK and FSK have been discussed. The distinctive characteristics associated with FSK can also be discussed. For starters, FSK tends to be more successful and can collect more victims than their male counterparts (Wilkins, 2004). Researchers believe this is possible because most solo FSK tends to exercise more control, patience, and planning when it comes to their crimes. FSK is also able to use the misogynist culture of the west against them since many people believe women are not capable of serial murder. However, researchers have found that as much as 30% of all serial killers could be female, which would destroy the sentiment that “women are not capable of serial murder”.

                    <h3>Mental Health</h3>
                    <p>Similarly to their male counterparts some FSK also suffer from mental illness or traumas that influence their killings (Frei et al., 2006). Most commonly FSK, in particular, tend to suffer most often either from some kind of trauma and PTSD associated with that trauma, which can spark “revenge murders” where the FSK will go after people that share characteristics with the person who they associate with their trauma (Arrigo & Griffin, 2004). A good example of this would be Aileen Wuornos, who was discussed above. Another common disorder found in FSK is malignant narcissism (Frei et al., 2006). This one specifically relates to Angel of Death killers. These female serial killers also have a kind of “hero” or “god” complex (Farrell et al., 2013) These types of killers truly believe that they should and can decide if someone should live or die. They also often believe that they are simply doing a favor by these “dying” people out of their pain and suffering, even when some of the victims were not near their deathbed. These two types of FSK are most often associated with mental illness. That being said, there have been other FSK who have suffered from depression and other mental illnesses.
