                                <p>
                                    “Angel of Death'' killer is a subtype that pertains to female serial killers (FSK) and their male counterparts (Miller, 2014). Angel of Death killer is also considered to be a healthcare serial killer (Yardley & Wilson, 2016). Kelleher and Kelleher’s typology details this type of killer as a female who will consistently kill people who have been placed into her care for medical and comfort support (Farrell et al., 2013; Yardley & Wilson, 2016). She will almost exclusively commit her crimes in some kind of institution like a hospital, nursing home, or another care facility. These killers are almost always nurses, caretakers, or other healthcare professionals (Farrell et al., 2013; Miller, 2014; Yardley & Wilson, 2016). Below there are more specific characteristics relating to the Angel of Death subtype.

                             <h3>Motives</h3>
                                 <p>
                                    The most common motive for these killers is power (Farrell et al., 2013). These killers like to play “god” and like to have control over whether their patients live or die. Another perceived motive is mercy or compassion (Yardley & Wilson, 2016). Sometimes there is even a financial motive since freeing up a bed means more patients. The overall motives for Angel of Death killers are not as refined as some other subtypes.

                            <h3>Victims</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Patients in hospitals or care facilities (Farrell et al., 2013; Miller, 2014; Yardley & Wilson, 2016). They can range anywhere in age from a young child to an elderly patient. Most are sick, but not all of them are terminally ill.

                            <h3>Method</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The method used by the killer depends on the victim. The killer will often use their medical knowledge to commit the murder (Gurian, 2011). One common method for older adults or elderly patients is injecting the patient with a lethal dose of potassium or insulin (Farrell et al., 2013). When killing children it is common for the FSK to suffocate the child with a pillow.

                            <p>
                                The average span depends on how spaced out the victims are, but the FSK is usually able to kill 8 or more people before she is caught (Farrell et al., 2013)

                            <p>
                                In one study conducted by Harrison et al., they determined that as many as 1 in 5 FSK could fall into the Angel of Death subtype (2015). This would make it one of if not the most common subtype of FSK.
